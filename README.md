hAzzle - alpha
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hazzlejs/alpha.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hazzlejs/alpha)

Experimental - not for commercial use!

hAzzle - alpha are a test project where the main goal are to use pure, native Javascript, to gain better performance.

It's modular, and super fast, and contains some of the functions known from jQuery such as next(),prev(), siblings(), and also functions known from other libs such as Loadash and underscore.

It's goal is to follow ES5 and ES6 standards. 

It's also possible now to use similar functions that you may know from Loadash and underscore.js to deal with arrays. The 'collected' selectors are now an internal array.

Feedback wanted!!
